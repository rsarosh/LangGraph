Causes
Rett syndrome is caused by genetic mutations, also known as pathogenic variants. Genetic mutations can be hereditary, when parents pass them down to their children, or they may occur randomly when cells are dividing. Genetic mutations may also result from contracted viruses, environmental factors, such as UV radiation from sunlight exposure, or a combination of any of these. Learn more about genetic diseases from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) https://medlineplus.gov/geneticdisorders.html.

If you suspect you may have this disease, you may want to start collecting your family health history. Information such as other family members who have had similar symptoms, when their/your symptoms first appeared, or exposures to any potential disease-causing environmental factors should be discussed with your medical team. This tool from the Surgeon General can help you collect your family health history (https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/about/index.html).

Known Genetic Mutations


Rett syndrome is caused by genetic mutations in the following known gene(s):

MECP2
Learn more about these genes by searching them on the National Library of Medicine (NLM) (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/).

Given these known genetic mutation(s), you may want to ask your health care team if genetic testing is right for you. Genetic tests are laboratory tests that use samples of blood, saliva, or other tissues to help identify changes in genes, chromosomes, or proteins. Genetic testing can help confirm or rule out a suspected genetic disease, or can provide other useful information to your health care team. Learn more about genetic testing from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) (https://www.genome.gov/FAQ/Genetic-Testing).

Can This Disease Be Passed Down From Parent to Child?

Yes. It is possible for a biological parent to pass down genetic mutations that cause or increase the chances of getting this disease to their child. This is known as inheritance. Knowing whether other family members have previously had this disease, also known as family health history, can be very important information for your medical team. This tool from the Surgeon General can help you collect your family health history learn more https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/about/index.html.

There are multiple ways, or patterns, a disease can be inherited depending on the gene(s) involved. Based on GARD's current data, this disease can be inherited in the following pattern(s):
X-Linked


X-linked inheritance means the genetic mutation is located on the X chromosome, one of the sex chromosomes. The male sex chromosome pair consists of one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The female sex chromosome pair consists of two X chromosomes (XX). Because males have just one X chromosome, it takes only one copy of the mutated gene to cause the disease. Females that have one copy of the mutated gene may have symptoms similar to those experienced by affected males, but usually have less severe symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

Female parents with one X-linked mutated gene have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to each of their biological children. Male parents with an X-linked mutated gene will pass on the mutation to all their female children but cannot pass the mutation on to their male children.

Learn more about inheritance patterns from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/inheritance/inheritancepatterns/).

When Do Symptoms of Rett syndrome Begin?
Symptoms of this disease may start to appear as an Infant.

The age symptoms may begin to appear differs between diseases. Symptoms may begin in a single age range, or during several age ranges. The symptoms of some diseases may begin at any age. Knowing when symptoms may have appeared can help medical providers find the correct diagnosis.

Diagnostic Journey
On average, it takes more than six years to receive an accurate rare disease diagnosis. Many primary care providers (PCPs) may not be familiar with rare diseases, and you may need to see multiple specialists to reach the correct diagnosis. However, advocating for yourself with your healthcare team may help speed your time to diagnosis. To combat common challenges, be prepared:
Find disease-specific information to discuss with your healthcare providers.
Ask for diagnostic tests.
Request referrals to specialists.
Knowing where to start your diagnostic journey and how to navigate the next steps are critical to speeding your time to diagnosis


Your Diagnostic Team
How can a diagnostic team help?
Establishing care with a dedicated primary care provider (PCP) is an important early step in your rare disease journey. A PCP can help improve care and shorten the time to diagnosis by providing referrals to the appropriate specialists. These specialists, with advanced training in different body systems or types of diseases, can offer the specialized diagnostic procedures you need.

Use this tool (https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=Physician) by Medicare to find a PCP in your area by inputting your location and keyword "Primary Care Provider."

A PCP that specializes in the care of children is called a pediatrician. Use this tool (https://www.healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/find-pediatrician/Pages/Pediatrician-Referral-Service.aspx)  by the American Academy of Pediatrics to find a pediatrician in your area  by inputting your location.


Genetic specialists focus on diagnosing, treating, and managing patients with genetic changes that affect a personâ€™s health. Specialists known as genetic counselors and geneticists commonly interview patients about family history and discuss genetic risks to diagnose genetic conditions. They may also use genetic testing to determine a diagnosis. Genetic counselors often specialize in certain types of genetic diseases like cancer, or different life stages like prenatal or pediatric genetic counseling.

You may be able to find a genetic specialist  in your area (https://clinics.acmg.net/) (directory by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics).


Neurology specialists focus on diagnosing, treating, and managing diseases that affect the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Neurologists often use imaging studies, physical examination, or cognitive assessments to diagnose neurological diseases.

You may be able to find a neurologist (https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=Physician) in your area by inputting your location and keyword "Neurology" (directory by Medicare).

Multidisciplinary Care Centers
Is it time to find a multidisciplinary care center?

If you've visited your PCP, met with specialists, and undergone the recommended tests, but still do not have a confirmed diagnosis, it may be time to visit a multidisciplinary care center. Multidisciplinary care centers are usually teaching, university, or research hospitals that have teams of medical experts and specialists working together in the same location. This means a wide range of diagnostic tests and clinical knowledge are available at one facility, which can help increase communication and collaboration among your care team. The additional resources often available at multidisciplinary centers may help speed the time to diagnosis for rare diseases.

Rare Disease Experts
How can you find a rare disease expert?
If a diagnosis remains unknown despite extensive efforts by your PCP and specialists, it can be challenging to know what kind of expert you may need or where to find one. A rare disease expert is a care provider that has knowledge or training on specific disease(s), but there may only be a few experts in your state, region, or country. Rare disease experts may work at large research or teaching hospitals. In complex cases, coordinating with a network of experts can help your care provider find the right diagnosis. 
Contact a GARD Information Specialist for help finding an expert (https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/contact).

You can ask your care providers for help finding an expert or use directory tools to search for experts near you. The following organization(s) may maintain a list of experts or expert centers for people living with Rett syndrome:
